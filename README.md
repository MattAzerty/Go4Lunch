## Description
The Go4Lunch application is designed to be a collaborative application used by all employees. It allows you to search for a restaurant in the area, then select the one of your choice by sharing it with colleagues. In the same way, it's possible to consult the restaurants selected by colleagues in order to join them. Shortly before lunchtime, the application will notify the different employees to invite them to join their colleagues.
